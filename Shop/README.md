E-commerce Website with an Integrated Blog
This project represents a modern and scalable e-commerce solution built on a current and reliable technology stack. The goal was to create a functional, fast, and visually appealing platform that enables businesses to efficiently sell products and manage content.

Purpose and Target Audience
The website is designed for small and medium-sized businesses, creators, and anyone who wants to sell products online while also having the ability to publish blog content for marketing and customer engagement. A key advantage is the ease of managing all aspects of the business, from adding products to processing orders, without the need for technical expertise.

Technology Stack
Laravel: Used as the main PHP framework. Laravel provides a robust architecture, security, and efficiency. Its MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern enables clear and organized development.

FilamentPHP: Used to build the entire administrative panel. Filament is a powerful tool that allowed for fast and easy implementation of the CMS (Content Management System) for managing products, categories, orders, and blog posts. Its intuitive nature makes daily operations simple for the user.

MySQL: A relational database used for storing all data, including information about products, users, orders, and blog content.

Tailwind CSS: Used for the entire frontend design. Through its "utility-first" design philosophy, Tailwind enables the rapid construction of modern, fully responsive interfaces without leaving the HTML code.

Spatie Media Library: A crucial library for managing all multimedia content on the site (product images, blog post images, etc.). It enables the automatic generation of various image sizes, web optimization, and cleaner file organization.

Stripe & PayPal: Integrated as the primary payment processing systems. These platforms were chosen for their global availability, high security, and ease of use for the end customer.

Cviebrock/EloquentSluggable: A library that automatically generates an SEO-friendly slug (URL) from the titles of blog posts and products. This is essential for better search engine rankings and easier navigation.

Key Features
Dynamic E-commerce System: Complete functionality for selling products, including categorization, product viewing, a shopping cart, and the ordering process.

Modern CMS: The admin panel, developed with Filament, allows for easy adding, editing, and deleting of products, categories, and blog posts.

Integrated Blog: A dedicated blog module allows for publishing articles, which helps in attracting visitors and improving SEO.

Secure and Diverse Payments: Full integration of Stripe and PayPal for reliable and fast transaction processing.

Responsive Design: The website is fully adapted for display on all devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
