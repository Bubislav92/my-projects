Name: DigitalyTycoon


Purpose: DigitalyTycoon is a modern, professional web agency specializing in the creation and optimization of digital solutions. The main goal is to attract new clients by showcasing our portfolio, services, and professionalism. The website serves as a virtual business card and a sales tool.

Target Audience
The website is intended for small and medium-sized businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups who want to establish or improve their online presence. The target audience includes clients who need the following services:

New Website Creation: Businesses without an existing website.

Website Redesign: Clients with outdated websites who want a more modern and functional design.

E-commerce Store Development: Businesses that want to sell products or services online.

Consulting and Support: Clients who need technical support, maintenance, or digital marketing strategy.

Architecture and Technologies
The website is built on a robust and modern technology stack, ensuring high quality, performance, and ease of maintenance.

Backend:

  Laravel 11: A powerful PHP framework that provides an elegant structure for developing web applications. It was used for managing routes, the Blade templating system, and the overall project structure.

Frontend:

  HTML5 & Blade: Standard markup language with Laravel's Blade syntax for efficient content and component management.

  CSS & Styling:

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework was used for fast and flexible design without writing custom CSS code. Classes like flex, py-8, and bg-accent enabled rapid responsive design.

JavaScript:

AOS (Animate On Scroll): A library used for dynamic animations. Elements are animated when they are scrolled into view, which contributes to a modern and interactive user experience.

Vanilla JS: Pure JavaScript was used for small interactions such as opening the mobile menu or dynamic portfolio filtering.

Development Environment and Tools:

Vite: A modern bundling and compilation tool used instead of Webpack for faster development and hot reloading.

NPM (Node Package Manager): Used to install and manage front-end dependencies.

Git & GitHub: A version control system that enables change tracking and team collaboration.
